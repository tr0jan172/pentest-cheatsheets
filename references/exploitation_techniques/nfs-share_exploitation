# showmount -e $IP // Which folder has the server available to mount
# scanner/nfs/nfsmount // Metasploit module -- Scans NFS mounts and list permissions

# mount -t $IP:<folder_to_mount> <local_file> // Mount the available folder

If you mount a folder which contains files or folders only accesible by some user (by UID).
You can create locally a user with that UID and using that user you will be able to access the file/folder.
