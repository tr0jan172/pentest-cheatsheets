			##--- BINARY CAPABILITIES PRIVILEGE ESCALATION ---##
# "getcap / -r 2>/dev/null"
Use to look for binary special capabilites which have special
root read or write or both permissions and can be used to escalate privileges

==================================================================================================================

			##--- KERNEL EXPLOITS ---##
Once inside the machine "uname -a" and "cat /etc/*-release" to find kernel and OS info
(Many kernels are vulnerable, search through searchsploit or google)
 *** Whenever possible transfer yourself LINPEAS and PSPY to enumerate everything ***

==================================================================================================================

			##--- SUID-GUID PRIV ESC ---##
# ALWAYS LOOK THROUGH SUID AND GUID BINARIES
*** SUID Binaries ***
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

*** GUID Binaries ***
find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null

For privilege escalation techniques look for the binary in GTFObins.

==================================================================================================================

			##--- ENVIRONMENT PATH MANIPULATION PRIVILEGE ESCALATION ---##
Sometimes the sysadmins won't properly configure their scripts and if they fail to specify the path,
to the binary called in the script a hacker could manipulate that binary. Simply by writing his code into
a file of the same name and making it executable. After that the only thing to do is to append the nasty binary
directory to the current path, and execute whatever script or binary is calling it.
Always make sure that the binary that is called has a specified path and it's not left to the PATH variable to
decide.

			##--- USING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES TO ELEVATE PRIVILEGES ---##
Some environment variables can be exploited if left unchecked.
*** LD_PRELOAD ***
LD_PRELOAD is an environment variable used on Unix-like operating systems to load additional
dynamic libraries before all others when a program is run.
This can be used to override functions in other shared libraries.

If a user has LD_PRELOAD as env_keep+ when executing sudo commands, it can be exploited by
if an attacker can set LD_PRELOAD to point to a malicious shared library, and this environment variable is
preserved when running commands with sudo, it allows the attacker to
execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
